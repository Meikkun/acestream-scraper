3. ~~Complete EPG XML generation~~ (Completed)
4. ~~Add search service and endpoints~~ (Completed)
5. ~~Develop system configuration and health endpoints~~ (Completed)
6. ~~Implement WARP service and UI~~ (Completed)
7. Compile and run both backend and frontend to check for errors
   - Use `run.bat` (Windows) or `run.sh` (Linux/macOS) scripts in the v2 directory
   - Verify all features are working correctly
   - Fix any bugs or issues discovered during testing
8. Add authentication system (if needed)
9. Add unit and integration tests

## Technical Notes

### Database Compatibility

For compatibility with the existing application, we're maintaining the same database schema structure. Key models to implement:

```sql
- AcestreamChannel
- ScrapedURL
- TVChannel
- EPGSource
- EPGChannel
- EPGProgram
- EPGStringMapping
- Setting
```

### API Endpoint Patterns

All API endpoints follow these patterns:

- Consistent error handling
- Pydantic validation
- OpenAPI documentation
- Dependency injection for services
- Proper status codes

### Development Workflow

1. Implement data models and DTOs
2. Create repository layer
3. Implement service layer with business logic
4. Create API endpoints
5. Document the API
6. Write tests
7. Implement frontend components

## Issues and Challenges

1. EPG XML parsing - The current implementation provides a simplified version of XML parsing. For production, a more robust implementation with proper date/time handling and XML structure validation will be needed.
   
2. Backend-Frontend Type Consistency - We need to ensure that TypeScript interfaces in the frontend match exactly with the Pydantic models in the backend. Currently this is manually maintained, but we could explore tools to auto-generate TypeScript types from OpenAPI specs.
   
3. Testing Strategy - Need to develop a comprehensive testing strategy covering unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
