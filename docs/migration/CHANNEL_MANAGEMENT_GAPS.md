## 2. Improvements in V2

- RESTful API for all channel operations
- React-based UI with advanced filtering, pagination, and search
- Upsert behavior for channel creation (idempotent)
- More robust error handling and validation
- Backend now generates channel IDs (UUID) automatically
- Improved test coverage and modular service/repository structure

---

## 3. Missing/Regressed Features in V2

- Some template-driven UI features (e.g., inline edit, quick actions) are not yet in React

_Note: Batch assign and quick edit modals/dialogs are now implemented in the V2 frontend. See Section 4 for remaining actionable requirements and Section 6 for progress tracking._

---

## 4. Migration/Implementation TODO

- [x] Complete backend wiring for all bulk operations (edit, delete, activate) in `v2/backend` and connect to React UI in `v2/frontend`
- [x] Port CSV import/export for channels in `v2/backend` and `v2/frontend`
- [x] Add advanced/custom field filtering options to React UI and backend API in `v2/frontend` and `v2/backend`
- [x] Re-implement missing modals/dialogs (batch assign, quick edit) in `v2/frontend`
- [x] Enhance activity log UI for channels to match V1 detail in `v2/frontend`
- [x] Add inline edit/quick actions to React table in `v2/frontend`
- [x] Ensure all error cases are handled gracefully in React UI in `v2/frontend`
- [x] Add more tests for edge cases (bulk, import, error handling) in `v2/backend` and `v2/frontend`

---

## 6. Progress Tracker

- [x] All CRUD operations parity
- [x] Bulk operations parity
- [x] Import/export parity
- [x] Filtering/search parity
- [x] UI/UX parity (modals, quick actions)
- [x] Activity log parity
- [x] All tests passing
