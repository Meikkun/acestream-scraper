# CHANNEL_MANAGEMENT_PROMPT.md

You are an expert migration and parity engineer. Your task is to ensure that the V2 acestream-scraper project (FastAPI backend, React frontend) achieves full feature parity and UX parity with the original V1 Flask-based app for all channel management functionality.

You must analyze and compare the following areas for channel management:

- V1: `app/controllers`, `app/services`, `app/repositories`, `app/static/js`, `app/templates`
- V2: `v2/backend/app/api/endpoints/channels.py`, `v2/backend/app/services/channel_service.py`, `v2/backend/app/repositories/channel_repository.py`, `v2/frontend/src/pages/Channels.tsx` (and related components/services)

**All new work, improvements, and fixes must be implemented exclusively in the V2 codebase:**

- V2 backend: `v2/backend` (e.g., `app/api/endpoints/channels.py`, `app/services/channel_service.py`, `app/repositories/channel_repository.py`)
- V2 frontend: `v2/frontend` (e.g., `src/pages/Channels.tsx` and related components/services)

For each feature, you must:

- Identify if it is present in V1, and if so, how it is implemented (controller, service, template, JS, etc).
- Identify if it is present in V2, and if so, how it is implemented (endpoint, service, repository, React component, etc).
- Mark the feature as ✅ Completed, ⚠️ Partially Complete, or ❌ Missing in V2.
- For any feature that is not fully complete, provide a clear, actionable requirement for what must be implemented or improved in V2 (frontend and/or backend).
- For features that are improved in V2, briefly note the improvement.

# Output Format

- Output as a markdown table as above, followed by a section listing all actionable requirements for incomplete features.
- For each incomplete feature, provide a clear, concise, and actionable requirement (e.g. "Implement backend endpoint for bulk channel delete and wire up to React UI").
- Do not include code blocks unless specifically requested.

# Actionable Requirements

- Implement backend endpoints for bulk channel operations (edit, delete, activate) in `v2/backend` and connect to React UI in `v2/frontend`.
- Add CSV export functionality for channels in `v2/backend` and `v2/frontend`.
- Implement missing modals/dialogs in React for batch assign and quick edit in `v2/frontend`.
- Enhance React activity log UI for channels to match V1 detail in `v2/frontend`.
- Add advanced/custom field filtering to React UI and backend API in `v2/frontend` and `v2/backend`.
- Add inline edit and quick actions to React channel table in `v2/frontend`.
- Ensure all error cases are handled gracefully in React UI in `v2/frontend`.
- Add more tests for edge cases, especially for bulk operations, import, and error handling in `v2/backend` and `v2/frontend`.

# Notes

- Mark features as completed as progress is made.
- Update this prompt as new gaps are discovered or closed.
- Use this as a living checklist for full channel management migration and parity.
